		// Git is intialised and it is ready to transfer the code to cloud
		// 3 steps are there (Copy your code to local git repo and then same thing push it Cloud Repo)
		// Red -- Nothing is Saved
		// Green --> selected file is saved
		// Git add --> It will save the code
		// Git commit --> It will commit to the local git Repo
		//When you say git commit --> All the commited files will be there in localgit repo
		// Now you have to set which repository to be saved --> git remote add
		// Git Push  --> It will commit/Pushed to the cloud Repo
		//git push success
